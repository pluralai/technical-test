# Technical Test

There is a frontend application located in packages/app

There is an api located in packages/api

Your mission (should you choose to accept it), is to visualise the file data as a tree structure

This is a pair programming exercise that you will drive, dylan is available to jump in on anything you need help with, he has particular expertise in:
  - typescript
  - the xlsx npm library

Aim to first quickly familiarize yourself with the code base and ask any questions about the code or the task

Once you feel comfortable you should then aim to format the data into a tree-like structure

And then finally find a reasonable representation of the formatted data as if it were to be shown to a non-technical person
